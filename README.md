# franka_interactive_controllers

Control interface built on top of [franka_ros](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/franka_ros.html) that allows to control the franka robot arm in several joint and Cartesian space impedance control schemes for interactive, safe and reactive (mostly DS-based) motion planning and learning. This low-level control interface is used and developed by/for [Prof. Nadia Figueroa](https://github.com/nbfigueroa) and her collaborators and students. Initially developed at MIT in the [Interactive Robotics Group](https://interactive.mit.edu/) continued development at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/).

## Installation
Besides [franka_ros](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/franka_ros.html) and by consequence [libfranka](https://github.com/frankaemika/libfranka) this package depends on several other code repositories that are robot-agnostic and useful for control and learning of motion policies from demonstrations. 

To install this repo and all its dependencies do the following steps:
* In your catkin src directory clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nbfigueroa/franka_interactive_controllers.git
```
* wstool gets all other git repository dependencies, after the following steps you should see extra catkin 
  packages in your src directory.
```
$  wstool init
$  wstool merge franka_interactive_controllers/dependencies.rosinstall 
$  wstool up 
```
* Query and installs all libraries and packages 
```
$ rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro <your-ros-distro> 
```

* Install some additional python dependencies
```
$ sudo apt install python3-psutil python3-tkinter
```

* Finally complie
```bash
  $ cd ~/catkin_ws
  $ catkin_make
  $ source devel/setup.bash
  $ catkin_make
  $ rospack profile
```
 You might need to source the `./bashrc` file and compile again if the first compliation could not find some of the in-house dependencies. If `roscd` doesn't find the compiled packages run `rospack profile`.
